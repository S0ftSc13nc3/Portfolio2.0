    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate software engineering student with a strong commitment to using technology as a force for good. What makes me unique is my deep desire to solve one of the most pressing challenges facing youth in South Africa and across Africa unemployment. I don’t just see code as lines on a screen; I see it as a powerful tool to create real-world solutions that connect young people to meaningful job opportunities and skills development.
My journey is driven by a mission to contribute to social and global responsibility by developing user-centered, impactful software platforms that empower youth and foster economic growth. I am particularly inspired by the idea of becoming a Chief Technology Officer, where I can lead innovative tech projects that create scalable change and open doors for countless young people.
In everything I do, I combine strong technical skills with leadership, creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning. Whether I’m debugging code or brainstorming ways to build a digital platform for job seekers, my goal is to make technology accessible, inclusive, and transformational.
